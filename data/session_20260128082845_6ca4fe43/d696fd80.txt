Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks
that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include perception, reasoning, learning, decision-making,
and language understanding. The origins of AI can be traced back to the mid‑20th century when researchers began
questioning whether machines could think.

Early AI systems were rule‑based and relied heavily on symbolic logic. These systems performed well in constrained
environments but failed when exposed to real‑world uncertainty. Over time, the limitations of rule‑driven approaches
led to the development of data‑driven models. This transition marked a fundamental shift in how intelligence was
modeled computationally.

Modern AI systems rely on large datasets, statistical models, and optimization techniques. Machine perception allows
systems to interpret images, audio, and sensor data. Reasoning engines help machines evaluate multiple possibilities
before choosing an action. Learning algorithms enable adaptation based on past experience.

AI plays a critical role in healthcare by assisting doctors with diagnostics, medical imaging analysis, and treatment
planning. In finance, AI is used for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and credit scoring. In education, adaptive
learning platforms personalize content according to student progress.

Ethical concerns surrounding AI include bias, transparency, accountability, and job displacement. Biased datasets can
lead to unfair outcomes, making responsible data collection essential. Explainable AI aims to make model decisions
understandable to humans.

Future AI research focuses on general intelligence, human‑AI collaboration, and energy‑efficient computation.
Governments and organizations worldwide are developing policies to ensure safe and beneficial AI deployment.

Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks
that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include perception, reasoning, learning, decision-making,
and language understanding. The origins of AI can be traced back to the mid‑20th century when researchers began
questioning whether machines could think.

Early AI systems were rule‑based and relied heavily on symbolic logic. These systems performed well in constrained
environments but failed when exposed to real‑world uncertainty. Over time, the limitations of rule‑driven approaches
led to the development of data‑driven models. This transition marked a fundamental shift in how intelligence was
modeled computationally.

Modern AI systems rely on large datasets, statistical models, and optimization techniques. Machine perception allows
systems to interpret images, audio, and sensor data. Reasoning engines help machines evaluate multiple possibilities
before choosing an action. Learning algorithms enable adaptation based on past experience.

AI plays a critical role in healthcare by assisting doctors with diagnostics, medical imaging analysis, and treatment
planning. In finance, AI is used for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and credit scoring. In education, adaptive
