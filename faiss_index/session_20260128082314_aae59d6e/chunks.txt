and language understanding. The origins of AI can be traced back to the mid‑20th century when researchers began
questioning whether machines could think.

environments but failed when exposed to real‑world uncertainty. Over time, the limitations of rule‑driven approaches
led to the development of data‑driven models. This transition marked a fundamental shift in how intelligence was
