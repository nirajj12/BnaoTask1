Clearing a data science interview isn't a big deal if you
are well prepared. But the fact is that data science
borrows concepts from many fields and that's why you
need to have

s from many fields and that's why you
need to have knowledge of all those fields to clear a
data science interview.
Though there are different jobs related to data like data
analyst, data engineer, Big data developer, all these
domains are not the same.
Data scientist's job profiles differ from all these in a lot
of ways. 
There are a lot of concepts that you need to be aware of
for clearing a data science interview.
Believe me, I have gone through a lot of interviews and
failed many. The reason

gh a lot of interviews and
failed many. The reason was that, if you lack in any of
the areas, you will be discarded.
But, this doesn't make data science job interviews so
complicated. What is required for a data science job, is
already with you. 
You just need to sharpen those skills and along with
them, learn some new concepts.
This ebook is not for a detailed explanation of these
topics, but it is about what to read, where to read
from, and how to prepare for interview. Nitin Mukesh

Technical Tests
Interviews
If I want to summarize the
entire campus recruitment
process for data science
jobs, it can be divided into
two sections:
In campus recruitment, or in off-campus jobs too, the
first stage is to appear for a test. Those students who
clear the test are asked to appear for an interview.
In the data science domain, the technical tests are
mostly centered around common aptitude sections
which include, quantitative aptitude, reasoning,

---

s
which include, quantitative aptitude, reasoning,
sometimes English, or a few times coding.
Different companies have different types of tests. For
these tests, you should prepare basic aptitude. 
Coding tests are there in few companies only.
From a lot of tests that I have appeared in or seen,
during my campus placement journey, here are few
examples of which companies take what type of tests
for their data science profile:
Nitin Mukesh
Aptitude: Citi bank, ANZ, Wells Fargo, ICICI

: Citi bank, ANZ, Wells Fargo, ICICI
Lombard, IDFC First Bank, PharmaACE, Accenture,
FCS Limited, General Mills, 
Aptitude+Coding: Delhivery, Goldman Sachs,
Miko.ai, Flipkart, Icertis, Postman, TCS Research,
Honda R&D, 
Data Science-based test: Microsoft, Micron
Technology
Now, as you can see, most of the companies go for
aptitude tests. Though the companies taking coding
rounds visit some of the premier campuses only.
You should find out which company visits your college
each year and what are

ompany visits your college
each year and what are their recruitment processes. 
This is a really nice strategy to target a company that
you want to be in.
You should always do your own research during the
campus recruitment drive. Nitin Mukesh

ents
To prepare for aptitude sections, you can use the
following  resources:
For beginners, Quantitative aptitude by R S Agarwal is
really a good book. I have personally used this book
for my aptitude preparations.
Most of the students feel comfortable with the
aptitude section. Mostly aptitude can be solved
without extra preparations.
But to get accuracy and speed, you can think of
preparing for it too. 
If you are thinking of preparing for aptitude from any
book mentioned above, it can take a

tude from any
book mentioned above, it can take a lot of time if you
go solving each and every question. 
I mean the Book By R. S. Agarwaal has more than 700
pages,
Nitin Mukesh
Read the formula given at beginning of a chapter,
solve 10 questions from that chapter.
From the previous two chapters solve 4 questions
from each.
Reading the whole book will require a lot of time. Also,
you need to prepare for the interview part. So, it is not
possible to dedicate most of the preparation time to
the ap

to dedicate most of the preparation time to
the aptitude section only.
But, there is a strategy that you can opt.
What I call it is the 10-2-4 Rule.
So according to this rule, you have to follow the given
steps each day:
This way you will be able to go through all the chapters
in 15-20 days. Now, each day solve few questions from
4-5 chapters at once. 
Also, appear for the online mock test that you can get
on the website given above.
Even if you feel confident, keep practicing few

feel confident, keep practicing few
questions on regular basis. 
10-2-4 Rule
Nitin Mukesh
Now if you have cleared the aptitude round, here
comes the interview. The interview questions are
mainly centered on your resume, job profile, and your
academic course(if you are from mathematics,
statistics, computer science, or related fields).
But few topics are commonly asked if you are
appearing for a data science interview. You should
brush up on these basics concepts and also try to have
some mock in

basics concepts and also try to have
some mock interviews in prior.
What I have personally experienced is that in the
beginning, we prepare aptitude very well, but as the
campus placement goes on, if we are not selected in
any company or any interview, we leave practicing
aptitude and only focuses on interview.
Just solve a few questions. Maybe once a week you can
do it so that in the next company you will be able to
perform well again.
Enough about the aptitude, lets now move to the
interview

bout the aptitude, lets now move to the
interview preparation section.  
Nitin Mukesh

While preparing for data science interviews, you
should take notes and also prepare from questions
that have already been asked in companies in
interviews.
For your reference, I have already listed the interview
questions towards the end of this ebook. These
questions have been given topic-wise along with the
name of companies in which these questions have
been asked.
Before mentioning the topics

asked.
Before mentioning the topics
that are commonly asked in data
science interviews, I would like to
list some key points you must
take care of while preparing for
interviews.
The first question that an interviewer is going to
ask you will be, "Tell me about yourself." Prepare
this question really well. Later in this guide, I'll
explain how to answer this question effectively.
You should be well prepared with your resume.
The interviewer doesn't know about you, what he
has with you is your r

has with you is your resume. So, be well prepared
with your resume.

Mean, Median, Mode and its properties
Random variables
Skewness, Kurtosis
Expectations and Variance with properties
Correlation and Covariance

Now let's quickly reveal all those topics that you
should be preparing for a data science interview.
If you are from Statistics, Computer Science, operation
research, or data science-oriented degrees, chanc

research, or data science-oriented degrees, chances
are high that you might already be knowing most of
the topics.
But, as I always say, don't forget to revise these. Most
of the time we don't remember what we have studied
a long back. So, without any hesitation, go back to
revise all those concepts from your course notes. 
I have also listed some of the books and courses from
where you can read these topics.

If you are appearing for a data science profile, most
of the time, questions are based on the topics that
have been mentioned above.
But, as I have told in the beginning that the data
science profile nowadays has been diversified. 
The company now hires for more specific roles in
the data science domain, like Machine learning
Engineer, R

---

science domain, like Machine learning
Engineer, Research Scientists, Time series analysts,
banking companies like ANZ, Citi, Wells Fargo, IDFC
First bank, etc hires for Modelling risk analysts or
financial analysts.
Other product-based companies hire NLP
engineers, Computer vision engineers, Image
processing specialists, etc, which are deep learning
specified roles.
But, deep learning is an entirely different domain.
This ebook is only for data science specialized roles.
In data science specifi

science specialized roles.
In data science specified roles, the interview will be
around these topics+your resume+ Job profile.
Nitin Mukesh

Make a nice resume: A resume is very important
for any job interview. Resume-making can be a
tedious task, but a good resume is not made in a
single day. 
You will have to sit for many days, making small
changes, consulting with your senior or some experts,
and ask for advice.
Make sure that your resume doesn't look
overqualified or underqualified. 
You ma

---

sn't look
overqualified or underqualified. 
You may be wondering, why an overqualified resume
is bad?
Well, being “overqualified” is seen as a bad thing, not
because someone “overqualified” will perform too
well, but because they are expected to be dissatisfied
with the job. 
Granted, a person who is “overqualified” will generally
learn their job in a minimal time.
If you are in an overqualified zone, you might be over-
questioned by the interviewer and can have a bad
interview.
I have been reje

---

wer and can have a bad
interview.
I have been rejected from a lot of interviews due to
being over questioned. Nitin Mukesh
Improve your communication skills: You may be
knowing a lot of things in data science, have done
awesome projects, and are well-versed with
everything, but you are not able to explain
yourself, guess what? You will be rejected.
So, don't make this mistake. Spend some time making
a good resume. Take help from others. It takes some
time to make an awesome eye-catching resume.

---

some
time to make an awesome eye-catching resume.
It is a harsh truth that the company prefers one with
good communication skills rather than one with
complete knowledge.
And if you have both, then you are gold.
But, what if you are not able to explain yourself in
the interview? 
This can be fixed. You need to learn to explain things
better. 
Record yourself over the phone and watch it, listen to
your recorded voice, see how it sounds. Have
questions discussion with your friends. Discuss in the

---

ions discussion with your friends. Discuss in the
group. Have a group mock interview with your friends
in which one will explain the answers to a group.
Nitin Mukesh
With practice, you can easily master this skill. But,
don't ignore it. What students commonly think is, I am
an expert in data science, nothing will happen if my
communication skills are bad.
But, guess what happens? 
The interviewer will give preference to those who can
explain. So, start to prepare early, work on your weak
points,

---

start to prepare early, work on your weak
points, and do outstanding in any interview.
Engage yourself in the interview: Don't just sit
answering what the interviewer asks you. The most
important thing is you have to be present in the
interview. 
When told, ask questions from the interviewer. Ask
how their journey has been till now. When you don't
know the answer, ask if they can give some additional
hints and then try to solve. This will certainly have a
positive impact on the interviewer. Nit

nly have a
positive impact on the interviewer. Nitin Mukesh
Don't interrupt the interviewer: If the
interviewer asks anything and you know the
answer very well, then don't interrupt in between.
Let the interviewer complete the question.
After the interviewer finishes, you can start. I had this
bad habit of interrupting. But, I came to know about
this mistake during one of the mock interviews.
Also, if you don't know the answer to any of the
questions, then you can politely say that "Sir, I don't

---

ions, then you can politely say that "Sir, I don't
know the answer." or "I have not come across this
term till now."
You are not supposed to know everything. I myself
was only able to answer 85% of questions during the
interview for the company I was placed in.
My one of the batchmate who was placed at highest
package from our department was able to answer 80%
of the questions.
The key is that, whatever you explain, be clear, be
specific, use examples and tell an amazing story out of
these.   
S

---

mples and tell an amazing story out of
these.   
Start simple, be clear: When asked any questions,
explain in simple and clear language. Don't
complicate things. 
Be stress-free: If you will be stress-free during the
entire interview, you will be able to think clearly
and answer better.
Don't explain things in hurriedness, explain slowly. If
you need time to think, tell the interviewer, "Sir, can I
take one minute to think?"
Simplicity is key.
I still remember my first face-to-face interview for

still remember my first face-to-face interview for
Accenture. It was for a data science internship. Though
I was very much worried and anxious. But, as the
interview proceeds, I become more comfortable.
But, due to COVID-19, the entire placement procedure
was online. There was a problem with me. I could not
think focus and recall what I had learned in an online
interview. I usually used to get distracted and forget
things. 
I had found this thing before the placement procedure
was about to begin

before the placement procedure
was about to begin. Nitin Mukesh
Analyze yourself: During preparations, you
should analyze yourself at each step, like what you
need to study, find your weak spots, work on
them. 
I used to practice a lot with my laptop camera on. Also,
I used to have online mock interviews with my friends.
These things helped me a lot, and I started to feel
comfortable.
But as placement proceeded, failing a lot of interviews
really taught me how to handle pressure during
intervie

interviews. I
It's all part of learning. 
I advise maintaining a record of what you have to
read, what is still left, and with time update it. Keeping
a record of what you studied really makes things
easier.
After the interview also, write what was asked, what
were the questions that you weren't able to answer,
search on the internet, and read them.
This way, even if you are not selected, now you have
some experience. That's how ML models also learn.
Wit

e experience. That's how ML models also learn.
With more data, the models get better. Nitin Mukesh
Do your own research: If you are selected for an
interview, read about the company. Do your own
research. Find about what the company does, how are
their work environment, how is the working culture.
You will find some questions about the company that
HR may ask in HR Round.
Also, if you appear for any start-ups, do find about
them. Sometimes some fake companies do visits and
later revoke your job

ake companies do visits and
later revoke your job offer.
At IIT Bombay, a company that was offering 75 lakhs
CTC with 20 LPA gross package on day 14. Everyone
was shocked that any company is offering this much
on the second last day.
But, soon my friends informed me that this company
seems to be fake. We did much online research and
found that this company is really fake and had nothing
to offer.
We immediately informed the Placement cell, and
then the company was questioned. It was ultimately

en the company was questioned. It was ultimately
black-listed.
You know the funny part is the company has only one
employee who was HR, Founder, Interviewer, and
everything. Nitin Mukesh
Help others and take help: When you get placed,
help your friends in placement. The best part of
life is when you start helping each other.
I know it may sound shocking that such companies
dare to visit IIT Bombay for Placement. But, in the
COVID situation, the fake companies do try to take
advantage. So, be awa

ake companies do try to take
advantage. So, be aware of that. 
Always do your own research.
You should really be grateful for your part and help
others. 
You will really find yourself happy when your friends
will also be placed.  
Also, don't hesitate to take help
from your friends if you need it.
I was stupid that I took it so
late.. But believe me, put your
ego aside and take help. Give
mock interviews to them.

We’ll start by discussing guesstimates, for which
candidates are asked to come up with a figure,
usually the size of a market or the number of
objects in an area or to estimate a particular data. 
Although guesstimates are more commonly given
in interviews for consulting positions, they do pop
up in finance and analytics interviews as well.
Practicing guesstimates is a good way to begin
preparing for stress questions in finance
interviews, as th

for stress questions in finance
interviews, as they force candidates to think
aloud – precisely what interviewers want to see.
Why Guestimates?
Nitin Mukesh
The most important thing to remember about
brainteasers, guesstimates, or even simple math
questions that are designed to be stressful is to
let your interviewer see how your mind works.
And, that's what your interviewer wants to see.
The best approach for a guesstimate question is
to think of a funnel. You begin by thinking
broadly, then s

of a funnel. You begin by thinking
broadly, then slowly narrowing down the
situation towards the answer. Show how you
reach to answer. 
How to solve?
For any guesstimate or brainteaser question, you
will need to understand whether your interviewer
will be providing any direction or whether you will
have to make assumptions. 
 Nitin Mukesh
e.g. Let us say you
have to estimate the
number of trees on
your college campus.
You can start by asking few initial questions to the
interviewer like, will I

initial questions to the
interviewer like, will I have to estimate full-grown
trees or small trees too?
This shows you are trying to understand the
situation.
Then proceed with dividing your campus area into
two parts, heavily populated with trees and less
populated with trees. 
Then, you can make an initial estimate that let us
say per 100 square meters in densely populated
areas, 40 trees are there and hence calculate total
trees by dividing the area of the densely populated
region. The same g

e area of the densely populated
region. The same goes for the other one.
An Illustration
Nitin Mukesh
See, you don't have to be exact in your answer.
But, you have to show how can you break down a
problem to solve it efficiently. That is what
interviewer is interested in.
With this, let's see some of the guestimate
questions asked in real finance and analytics
interviewers by different comapnies.

It is the most important question in the interview. This is
the first question you will be asked. Though, if asked in
the technical round, the answer will be different than
what you say if asked in HR Round.

about my educationa

But, somehow I managed to tell
about my educational background and all. Then I was
blank.
Later I came to know that all the students prepared for
this question prior to the interview. I was stupid there
who had no idea about it. So, prepare this question really
well.
Here are the main components of the answer:
Let us see how can you make an ideal answer to this
question.

t and listen to it again
and again so that it should sound perfect. Make sure
that it should be between 60 seconds to 90 seconds. 
The answer to the same questions will be different for
the HR Round.
Here are the main components of this answer:
Education background and conclusion will be the same.
In the strength part, you have to tell about your strength
like time management, fast learners, dedication, etc, then
your hobbies and interests like music, sports, traveling,
etc.
Yes, the ideal answe

---

usic, sports, traveling,
etc.
Yes, the ideal answers should lie between 60-75
seconds.
Prepare two types of answer for this question in advance
and nail the interview.

You prepare for the campus placement, but not
everyone gets selected in the very first company.
But, you don't need to get disheartened 😔 . The
campus interview sometimes can be full of ups and
downs. You don't know which is your lucky day.
Despite being prepared, I was not able to clear the
interview during my campus placement s

---

o clear the
interview during my campus placement season. I was
able to clear most of the coding and aptitude tests,
but in the interview round, I was getting rejected.
During those hard times, it feels like everything is such
a waste. What you have been doing till now is of no
use.
You see your peers getting placed and here still you
are waiting for another chance. Maybe someone with
no experience or less technical skills than you is
getting placed and still, you are not.
Sometimes the interview

---

ed and still, you are not.
Sometimes the interviewer
praised me for the interview
round, but the company didn't
respond.
Self-doubt starts to kick in and you will start thinking
that maybe you are not made for this job. All those
lucky people got selected and you didn't.
But believe me, there is a lucky day for you. You can go
through all sadness. It's the consequences of what is
happening to us. 
You need to keep going. Prepare even more. Analyze
your mistakes. Improve them. Sometimes, there ma

---

e
your mistakes. Improve them. Sometimes, there may
not be your fault, accept it. 
The road to success is not easy and not fair for
everyone. After each interview, write a short note on
how you feel about this interview? Think if you need to
prepare more. Write those questions that you couldn't
answer. Revise those topics that you were not able to
explain clearly.
Improve yourself. You have to potential to get through
it. Everyone has to go through this pain sometimes. 
I had signed 110 companie

---

gh this pain sometimes. 
I had signed 110 companies, selected for tests in 40+
companies, interviewed 17 times before I got placed
as an ML Researcher at TCS. And there is still
someone who got placed even later.
I remember a story my brother was telling me when I
was continuously getting rejected from interviews.
"There was a student in his college. His coding and
aptitude skills were good. He had cleared tests and
appeared for 100+ companies during college
placement before he got placed. "
Kee

---

ring college
placement before he got placed. "
Keep going. You are going to learn a lot when one day
you will be placed. 
I'm able to write these things because I have
experienced the mindset of a student who is getting
rejected in every interview.
The key to an interview is simple: Prepare well, present
yourself even better. 
Put yourself 100% in the interview. Be confident and
explain clearly.
That's all.
All the best for your next data science job interview!!!
